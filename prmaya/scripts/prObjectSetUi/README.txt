UI to work with objectSet
- add, remove, reorder, export, import members

TODO:
- export / import members
- avoid unwanted maya behavior (clean solutions only possible with custom node?)
-- add duplicated members to set (custom sync attribute?, scriptjob?)
-- delete set when last member gets deleted (lock set current workaround)
