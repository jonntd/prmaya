### DESCRIPTION
* prmaya (structured like the default maya user folder) 
  * scripts
    * prSelectionUi: production proven
    * prObjectSetUi: production proven
    * manip_drag_panel_show: production proven
  * plugins
    * prAttractNode: production proven, the last time in Maya 2015. Does probably not work in the latest Maya version.
    * prHeatDeformer: not production proven. fStretch is better and open source by now, so I would recommend using that.
    * prPyMath: not production proven. Could be fine. I just wrote it.
    * prSlideNode: not production proven. ClosestPoint algorithm should be fine. The paper algorithm is not complete.
